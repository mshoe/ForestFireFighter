Game summary: Wild fire fighting game with helicopter with water pick up

Why we did this project: The tragedies of recent devastating fires have led our team to once more recognize the importance of fire safety. We wanted to make a multi-player game to increase the awareness of the uncontrollable nature of fire. In addition to increasing awareness, the players are given a chance to explore what the best way to fight fires are as a fire fighter. We have implemented a close-to-real-life fire propagation algorithms and fighting techniques, the effective strategies in real life would give advantages in this game. For example, fire fighters often perform a ‘criss-cross’ . By working as a team with multiple people, the users are also able to improve their cooperation skills, and communication skills while coming up with golden strategies in a limited time together.

Features that we implemented: 1. Randomly generated terrain with trees, grass, water 2. Multiplayer support 3. Different color for whether adding water or not on water 4. Camera that tracks each helicopter 5. Adding and dispensing water logic 6. Fire movements and sparks (how fire spreads) 7. Water movements and physics (how water droplets form splashes and affect nearby areas) 8. Scoring system for players 9. Main menu and level selection 10. Help menu with quick video run-through
